                <p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his
                    bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little
                    he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The
                    bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many
                    legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
                    helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream.
                    His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
                    its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the
                    table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that
                    he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
                    It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy
                    fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned
                    to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops
